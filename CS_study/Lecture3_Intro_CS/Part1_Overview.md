### Overview  

* Theme: Abstraction is Good but Don't Forget Reality

* Great Reality #1: types are not exact  
> overflow


* Great Reality #2: Know Assembly
> Compilers are mush better
> But, Understanding assembly is **key to machine-level execution model**
    - bugs
    - understanding source of program inefficiency
    - implementing system software


* Great Reality #3: Memory Matters
    - must be allocated and managed(dominated); referencing bug
    - not uniform 


* Great Reality #4: Performance
> example: copy


* Great Reality #5: Computers do more than execute programs
> networking


### Course Perspective  
: Most systems courses are builder-centric
- Computer Architecture; Design
- Operating Systems
- Compilers
- Networking

> 과정; Programs and Data - Memory Hierarchy - Exceptional Control Flow - Virtual Memory - Networking, and Concurency
